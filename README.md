# NIS-sectors
A public list of Sectors as defined by the NIS-Directive ("NIS-D"). See the [NIS Directive](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive) page for more infos.
The sectors are listed in the [NIS directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj) in Annex II.

This repository wants to offer the list in multiple machine readable formats to facilitate and easy the process of doing statistics based on the NIS-D sector in each members state.

The names in the sector list are copied verbatim from the NIS-D.

The mapping of sectors to organisations is not part of this repository.


# Caveats

Following typical best practices in statistics, we added the following categories:

  * "Other"
  * "Unknown"

These are not listed in the NIS-D! However, we offer them in this repository for statistical purposes when no other sector category from the NIS-D would fit  or when the sector is simply unknown. Use these two categories accordingly.

# Formats

Currently, the list is available in the following machine readable formats:

  * as CSV file
  * as (Postgresql) database / table dump in SQL syntax
  * as XLS file

# Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Please add new formats via pull requests!
